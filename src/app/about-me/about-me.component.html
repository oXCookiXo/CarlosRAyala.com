    <h3 class="center">Who am I</h3>
    <p class="center"><em>My name is Carlos</em></p>    
    <p>I graduated from the University of Houston-Downtown in May 2017 with a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics. I’ve always enjoyed taking apart things and putting them back together. Some of my parents fondest memories include me taking apart a VCR we used to have and putting it back together. So an interest in technology has always existed, but it wasn’t until high school that I invested my time into learning more about how things actually worked. My high school wasn’t a normal one, we had an engineering program that I enrolled in which shined a whole new light into what I new technology was. We studied 3D modeling using Autodesk inventor’s CAD program, we learned the concepts of programming by using some program similar to Unreal Engine where we would drag, drop and assign roles to each and everything placed. We were introduced to what engineering was including all the paperwork that it took to fully develop something along with coming up with an invention of our own. We were also taught how to solder and learn about circuitry in a class called digital electronics which supported my interest in hardware. In my sophomore year of school, I taught myself how to repair computers. Virus removal, reinstallation of OS, troubleshooting program errors, hard drive swaps, ram upgrade, motherboard replacement you name it. I even started printing flyers with a buddy of mine so we could get our name out. Sadly our small business wasn’t what I wanted to do, so I moved onto repairing mobile devices. I taught myself how to replace screens, apply LOCA, repair speakers, Bluetooth antennas, headphone jacks, anything and everything on the phone that could be replaced I could repair.  However, for whatever reason, I still wasn’t satisfied. Once senior year came around I finally had to choose what I wanted to do for undergraduate studies I was stuck between Computer engineering and Computer Science. I had to actually think to myself and decide what is it I wanted to do the rest of my life, and since the hardware side of technology never satisfied me, I decided to enter Computer Science and study development. After my first C++ course, I completely fell in love with development. I thought to myself, ” Wow I can type a couple of things and let the computer know what I wanted it to do.” Once I understood the concept of development I went on and made a couple side projects learned new languages and this trend continued up until today. There are so many languages and uses for them.  I enjoy development and haven’t begun to be tired of it.</p>
